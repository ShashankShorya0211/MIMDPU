# MIMDPU
# Basic Compiler

This is a basic compiler implementation for a simple C-like language. The compiler includes lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate representation (IR) generation, IR optimization, code generation, and final assembly into machine code.

## Features

- Lexical Analysis: Tokenizes the source code into meaningful symbols.
- Syntax Analysis: Parses tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- Semantic Analysis: Ensures type correctness and variable declarations.
- Intermediate Representation (IR) Generation: Converts AST into a lower-level representation.
- IR Optimization: Placeholder for optimizing the IR (not yet implemented).
- Code Generation: Converts optimized IR into assembly code.
- Assembly: Converts assembly code into machine code.
