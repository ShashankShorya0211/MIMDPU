The MIMDCompiler represents a significant evolution from the BasicCompiler, introducing support for parallel computing and expanding language features. Here are the key updates:

1. Parallel Computing Support
- Added a `PARALLEL` keyword and `ParallelStatement` node type in the AST.
- Implemented parallel code generation for Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD) architectures.
- Introduced `PARALLEL_BEGIN` and `PARALLEL_END` instructions in the intermediate representation (IR).

2. Enhanced Language Features
- Added support for increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators.
- Implemented compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`).
- Expanded binary operators to include bitwise operations.

3. Improved Syntax Analysis
- Enhanced the parser to handle more complex expressions and statements.
- Added support for function declarations with parameters.

4. MIMD Code Generation
- Implemented a new `code_generation` method that distributes instructions across multiple processors.
- Added a `generate_mimd_instruction` method to convert IR instructions to MIMD-specific code.

5. Optimizations
- Retained and potentially improved constant folding and propagation.
- Kept dead code elimination and control flow optimizations.

6. Lexical Analysis Updates
- Added new token types to support the expanded language features.

7. Semantic Analysis
- Updated to handle parallel statements and new language constructs.

8. IR Generation
- Modified to include parallel computing constructs and new language features.
