the newer version of the BasicCompiler class can handle loops. Specifically, it has been enhanced to parse and generate code for both for and while loops. Here's a breakdown of how the compiler handles loops:

1. Parsing for and while Loops
In the syntax analysis phase, the newer version introduces specific functions to handle loops:

parse_while_statement(): This function parses while loops, extracting the condition and the body of the loop.
parse_for_statement(): This function parses for loops, extracting the initialization, condition, update, and body of the loop.
2. Intermediate Representation (IR) Generation
The IR generation phase supports loops by generating the necessary labels and jump instructions to represent the loop's control flow. For example:

while Loop: The condition is evaluated before entering the loop. If the condition is false, a jump is made to the end of the loop. Otherwise, the loop body is executed, and after the body, execution jumps back to the condition.

for Loop: The initialization is performed first, then the condition is evaluated. If the condition is true, the loop body is executed. After the body, the update expression is evaluated, and execution jumps back to the condition for the next iteration.

Labels and jump instructions are used to implement the loop behavior.

3. Code Generation
In the code generation phase, the loops are converted into assembly code that includes the proper control flow for looping constructs. This includes:

Jump Instructions: Conditional jumps are used to check the loop condition and either execute the loop body or exit the loop.
Labels: Labels are used to mark the beginning of the loop, the loop body, and the end of the loop, allowing for control flow to jump to the appropriate locations during execution.
