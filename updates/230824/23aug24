Older Version (Before 23rd August 2024):

Handled basic tokens such as numbers, identifiers, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), assignment (=), semicolons, and whitespace.
The scope was limited to parsing simple arithmetic expressions and variable assignments.


New Version (After 23rd August 2024):

Expanded token recognition to include:
Keywords: if, else, while, return, int, float, char, void.
Logical Operators: &&, ||, !.
Comparison Operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.
Symbols: parentheses ((,)), braces ({,}), and commas.
This update allows the lexer to handle more complex language features such as control flow, comparisons, and logical expressions, which were previously unsupported.
