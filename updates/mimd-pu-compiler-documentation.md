# MIMD-PU Compiler: Detailed Documentation of Updates

## Overview

This document outlines the significant updates and improvements made to the MIMD-PU (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data Processing Unit) compiler since its initial implementation. The compiler has been enhanced to better support the unique architecture of the MIMD-PU, including its bit-serial processing capabilities and specialized operator structure.

## 1. Lexer Updates

### 1.1 Token Types
- Added support for bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`) to better align with the MIMD-PU's capabilities.
- Improved handling of compound operators (e.g., `&&`, `||`, `<=`, `>=`).

### 1.2 Error Handling
- Enhanced error reporting to include line and column information for invalid characters.

## 2. Parser Improvements

### 2.1 Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Implemented a more robust AST structure to represent the program's structure more accurately.
- Added support for bitwise operations in expressions.

### 2.2 Function Parsing
- Improved parsing of function definitions and function calls to better represent the MIMD-PU's execution model.

### 2.3 Error Recovery
- Implemented basic error recovery mechanisms to continue parsing after encountering syntax errors.

## 3. Semantic Analyzer Enhancements

### 3.1 Type Checking
- Implemented more rigorous type checking, especially for bitwise operations and function calls.
- Added checks for type compatibility in assignments and binary operations.

### 3.2 Scope Management
- Improved scope management to handle nested blocks and function scopes more effectively.

### 3.3 Function Analysis
- Enhanced analysis of function declarations and calls to ensure correct usage.

## 4. Intermediate Representation (IR) Generation

### 4.1 MIMD-PU Specific Instructions
- Introduced new IR instructions tailored to the MIMD-PU architecture, such as `SET_INPUTS`, `SET_OPERATOR`, and `COMPUTE`.

### 4.2 Memory Operations
- Added explicit `ALLOC` instructions to represent variable declarations.
- Improved handling of load and store operations to match the MIMD-PU's memory model.

### 4.3 Control Flow
- Enhanced representation of control flow structures (if, while, for) to better suit the MIMD-PU's execution model.

## 5. IR Optimization

### 5.1 Constant Folding
- Implemented constant folding optimization to evaluate constant expressions at compile-time.

### 5.2 Dead Code Elimination
- Added dead code elimination to remove unused variables and unreachable code.

### 5.3 Common Subexpression Elimination
- Implemented common subexpression elimination to reduce redundant computations.

## 6. MIMD-PU Code Generation

### 6.1 Instruction Set
- Developed a comprehensive set of MIMD-PU specific instructions, including:
  - `SET_INPUTS`: For setting up input operands
  - `SET_OPERATOR`: For selecting the operation to perform
  - `COMPUTE`: For triggering the computation
  - `GET_RESULT`: For retrieving the result of a computation

### 6.2 Variable Mapping
- Implemented a variable mapping system to translate IR variables to MIMD-PU specific variable identifiers.

### 6.3 Operator Tree Structure
- Adapted the code generation to better utilize the MIMD-PU's tree structure of operators.

## 7. Main Compiler Class

### 7.1 Compilation Pipeline
- Restructured the main compilation process to include all phases: lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, IR generation, IR optimization, and MIMD-PU code generation.

### 7.2 Verbose Output
- Added detailed output at each stage of compilation for better debugging and understanding of the compilation process.

### 7.3 Error Handling
- Implemented a `CompilationError` class for more informative error reporting.
- Added try-except blocks to catch and report errors at each compilation stage.

## 8. Testing and Validation

### 8.1 Example Programs
- Included example C programs to test and demonstrate the compiler's capabilities.

### 8.2 Output Verification
- Added functionality to print and verify the output at each compilation stage.

## Conclusion

These updates have significantly improved the compiler's ability to generate efficient code for the MIMD-PU architecture. The compiler now takes into account the unique features of the MIMD-PU, such as its bit-serial processing and specialized operator structure, resulting in more optimized and architecture-specific code generation.

Future work may include further optimizations specific to the MIMD-PU architecture, support for more complex C language features, and integration with a custom assembler or linker for the MIMD-PU.
